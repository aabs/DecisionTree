# Multi-Output Decision Tree

The purpose of this framework/tool is to allow you to deduce a decision tree from a tabular enumeration of cases.

The motivation for this came from an employer of mine whose analysts tended not to think in terms of rules, but could think at the level of "__if you give  me a case, I can tell you whether that qualifies__".  Given a set of cases in the form of a CSV file, this tool will analyse the data and build a decision tree out of the cases.  It will then attempt to reduce and optimise the tree somewhat (although there's ample room for improvement, so please feel free to get involved if you find it useful).

### How do I get set up? ###

It's currently in a very raw state at the moment.  I'll polish it as time allows.  Check out the unit tests for inspiration.
