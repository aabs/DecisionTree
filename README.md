# Multi-Output Decision Tree

The purpose of this framework/tool is to allow you to build a decision tree from a tabular enumeration of cases.

The motivation came from my employer whose analysts tend not to think in terms of rules, but can work at the level of "__if you give  me a case, I'll tell you if it qualifies__".  Given a set of cases in the form of a CSV file, this tool will analyse the data and build a decision tree out of the cases.  It will then reduce and optimise the tree somewhat (although there's ample room for improvement, so please feel free to get involved if you find it useful).

### How do I get set up? ###

It's currently in a very raw state at the moment.  I'll polish it as time allows.  Check out the unit tests for inspiration.
